# Status Bars Extended
This plugin extends the base functionality of the status bars plugin to allow for recoloring the left and right sidebars at different user set thresholds to user set colors. Up to ten thresholds and associated colors per sidebar may be set, and the base functionality of recoloring the hp bar when poisoned/venomed/diseased/parasited can be optionally enabled or disabled to over ride the user set color thresholds.

This is particuarly useful for places like tombs of amascut were you want to be very sure you have 50+ prayer points before attmepting to use the yellow keris special attack, and being below that can lead to confusion and death.
